If we had to pick one EDC accessory from the James Brand, it would be The Mehlville. This keychain is a carabiner carved from a solid piece of aluminum. Making it strong and light at the same time.

A functional design for a carabiner built like a tank.

We love the buttery smooth opening and closing of the carabiner gates. Because details matter, the James Brand added a bottle opener function to the Mehlville.

The Mehlville deserves its place among the **best keychains for men**.

### Keyhook in Raw Brass

As we like to say, less is more. This keychain is stripped down from everything to focus on its main function; keeping your keys together.

A low number of keychains were produced from casted raw brass. Due to the nature of this material, the Keyhook will gain a nice patina over time.
