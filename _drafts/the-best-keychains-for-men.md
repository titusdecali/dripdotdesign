### The best keychain for men - The Mehlville by the James Brand

The team behind the James Brand as demonstrated product after product how much they care about making functional and sturdy _EDC_ (everyday carry) tools.

If we had to pick EDC from the James Brand, it would be The Mehlville. This keychain is a carabiner tool carved from a solid piece of aluminum. This makes it strong and light at the same time. A functional design for a carabiner built like a tank. Its carabiner gate has a buttery smooth opening and closing motion. We particularly enjoy the bottle opener function of this keychain. The Mehlville deserves its place among the **best keychains for men**.

### Keyhook in Raw Brass

As we like to say, less is more. This keychain is stripped down from everything to focus on its main function; keeping your keys together. The Keyhook in Raw Brass was casted in raw brass in a low unit production batch. Due to the nature of raw brass, this keychain will gain a nice patina over time.  
This Taylor Stitch keychain is not bulky and will look great no matter what you wear. You could try for example a denim shirt or trousers from Taylor Stitch.

REQME designed this keychain to cute your seatbelt and shatters your car’s glass in the event of a car accident.
