If you are a watch enthusiast, you are most likely familiar with the french microbrand Baltic Watch. Like many new microbrand, Baltic Watch sprouted with the help of a crowdfunding campaign. In 2018, the French team behind this young watch brand released on Kickstarter two vintage-looking watches. The HMS 001 and the BICOMPAX 001. Within 30 days, Baltic Watch raised EUR 514,806 from 1,044 backers.

Thanks to the retro look of their watches, Baltic rallied a large community of watch aficionados. This allowed them to successfully launch on their website the Aquascaphe, without having to use the service of Kickstarter.

> Let's dive into the _Aquascaphe diving watch_, a 38mm timepiece.

### Going vintage with the Aquascaphe

When looking at the Aquascaphe, you will quickly recognize the curves and style from the Fifty Fantom by Blancpain. Baltic's "hommage watch" is available in three variations:

![Aquascaphe Black Cream, Blue Gilt, , Black & Silver](/uploads/Baltic Aquascaphe dive watches.png "The Aquascaphe dive watches")

* Blue Gilt - a blue bezel with a sunrays dial
* Black & Silver - silvered markers on the dial and bezel, together with a grainy dial
* Black Cream - creme colored markers on the dial and bezel as well as a grainy dial

The watch is packed with eye-pleasing details. We appreciate the sandwich-style markers 3, 6 and 9 shaped like triangles. The printed marker 12 is the only numeral on the Aquascaphe dial. This creates a unique combination of markers.

If you like to wear your diver with a stainless steel bracelet, you will have the possibility to purchase the **Aquasquaphe diving watch** with a BOR (beads-of-rice) bracelet for an extra US$87.

The absence of a date window brings simplicity and harmony to the dial.

### 38 mm of elegance

The Aquascaphe comes with all the features you can expect from a quality dive watch. Baltic Watch opted for a Japanese automatic movement from Miyota to keep the price attractive. With its thickness of 12 mm and a case size of 38mm, the Aquascaphe will be a discrete dive watch on your writs. Some might argue that a 38mm case is too small for a dive watch. A 42mm would have given a more manly look to this watch.

• Stainless steel 316L  
• Case size: 38mm diameter (39mm with the bezel) and a 47mm distance lug to lug  
• Case thickness: 12mm  
• Movement: automatic movement Miyota 9039 (Japan)  
• Dial: sandwich dial for the triangle markers 3, 6 and 9  
• Crystal: double domed sapphire glass  
• Bezel: unidirectional sapphire bezel  
• Crown: screw-down crown  
• Strap: stainless steel and rubber  
• Water resistance: 200 meters (200 ATM)

Colors: Blue Gilt, Black & Silver, Black Cream

### Manufacturing the Aquascaphe

The Aquascaphe, like the first two watches from Baltic, is assembled in France. What does it exactly mean?

All parts are made in Asia, shipped to France, where the final assembly is done. Baltic is not the only brand doing so. Well established watch brands are outsourcing the production of their parts in China before putting all the pieces together in Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy or the USA.

### Cost of the Aquascaphe diving watch

Compared to other dive watches from different microbrands, the Aquascaphe value proposition is not ''being an affordable watch''. You will have to spend 637 US$ when purchased with a rubber strap or 724 US$ if you prefer to wear the Aquascaphe with its BOR stainless steel bracelet.

If you don't mind the price and wish to wear a small case dive watch, this diver could be for you. If you are looking for more affordable options keep in eye on this blog, we will review upcoming timepieces debuting on crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indigogo.

### To sum up

Thanks to the success of the HMS 001 and the BICOMPAX 001, Baltic Watch didn't encounter a strong resistance when presenting the Aquascaphe to the watch community. With its classic design paying homage to the Fifty Fantom (Blancpain), this dive watch is a head-turner.

Sold between US$637 and US$724 (depending on the selected strap), some consumers might argue that the price is too high for a Miyota movement.

We would love to see this watch with a bigger dial. But, if you are looking for a discrete diving watch, this you could be the right one for you.
