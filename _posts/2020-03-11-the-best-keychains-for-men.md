A compact and sleek keychain featuring a multi-tool function. Upgrade your EDC with the Halifax.

Made from solid billet titanium, the Halifax stands out thanks to its black Cerakote finishing.

If we had to pick one EDC accessory from James, it would be The Mehlville. This keychain is a carabiner carved from a solid piece of aluminum. Making it strong and light at the same time.

A functional design for a carabiner built like a tank.

We love the buttery smooth opening and closing of the carabiner gates. Because details matter, James added a bottle opener function to the Mehlville.

The Mehlville deserves its place among the **best keychains for men**.

### The Keyhook in Raw Brass

We like to think that less is more. The Keyhook reflects this belief as it focuses only on keeping your keys together.

Don't expect to see many guys sporting this keychain as the Keyhook was produced in a small batch.

Due to the nature of raw brass, the Keyhook will like premium leather, gain a nice patina over time.
